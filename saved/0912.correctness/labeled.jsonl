You may select arbitrary indices l and r (1 ≤ l < r ≤ n) as the boundaries of the segment. \n  2. Then you replace the segment a[l … r] with it's cyclic shift to the left by an arbitrary offset d. The concept of a cyclic shift can be also explained by following relations: the sequence [1, 4, 1, 3] is a cyclic shift of the sequence [3, 1, 4, 1] to the left by the offset 1 and the sequence [4, 1, 3, 1] is a cyclic shift of the sequence [3, 1, 4, 1] to the left by the offset 2. \n\n\n\nFor example, if a = [1, \\color{blue}{3, 2, 8}, 5], then choosing l = 2, r = 4 and d = 2 yields a segment a[2 … 4] = [3, 2, 8].

{"name": "1579_E2. Array Optimization by Deque", "description": "In fact, the problems E1 and E2 do not have much in common. You should probably think of them as two separate problems.\n\nYou are given an integer array a[1 … n] = [a_1, a_2, …, a_n].\n\nLet us consider an empty [deque](https://tinyurl.com/pfeucbux) (double-ended queue). A deque is a data structure that supports adding elements to both the beginning and the end. So, if there are elements [3, 4, 4] currently in the deque, adding an element 1 to the beginning will produce the sequence [\\color{red}{1}, 3, 4, 4], and adding the same element to the end will produce [3, 4, 4, \\color{red}{1}].\n\nThe elements of the array are sequentially added to the initially empty deque, starting with a_1 and finishing with a_n. Before adding each element to the deque, you may choose whether to add it to the beginning or to the end.\n\nFor example, if we consider an array a = [3, 7, 5, 5], one of the possible sequences of actions looks like this:    1. |  add 3 to the beginning of the deque: |  deque has a sequence [\\color{red}{3}] in it;   \n---|---|---  \n  2. |  add 7 to the end of the deque: |  deque has a sequence [3, \\color{red}{7}] in it;   \n  3. |  add 5 to the end of the deque: |  deque has a sequence [3, 7, \\color{red}{5}] in it;   \n  4. |  add 5 to the beginning of the deque: |  deque has a sequence [\\color{red}{5}, 3, 7, 5] in it;   \n  \nFind the minimal possible number of inversions in the deque after the whole array is processed. \n\nAn inversion in sequence d is a pair of indices (i, j) such that i < j and d_i > d_j. For example, the array d = [5, 3, 7, 5] has exactly two inversions — (1, 2) and (3, 4), since d_1 = 5 > 3 = d_2 and d_3 = 7 > 5 = d_4.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) — the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases. \n\nThe first line of each test case description contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) — array size.

First, a new array a^{→ d} is defined as a cyclic shift of the array a to the right by d cells. The elements of this array can be defined as a^{→ d}_i = a_{(i + n - d) mod n}, where (i + n - d) mod n is the remainder of integer division of i + n - d by n. \n\nIt means that the whole array a^{→ d} can be represented as a sequence $$$a^{→ d} = [a_{n - d}, a_{n - d + 1}, …, a_{n - 1}, a_0, a_1, …, a_{n - d - 1}]$$$\n\n  2.

Their element-by-element \"AND\" equals to $$$[1  \\&  1, 0  \\&  0, 0  \\&  1, 1  \\&  0, 0  \\&  0] = [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]$$$ \n  3.

She wants to change the pattern written by Grandpa Sher, but to avoid offending him, she will choose one lowercase English letter and erase some (at her choice, possibly none or all) occurrences of that letter in string s.\n\nShe also wants to minimize the number of erased symbols from the pattern. Please help her and find the minimum number of symbols she can erase to make string s a palindrome, or tell her that it's impossible. Notice that she can only erase symbols equal to the one letter she chose.\n\nA string is a palindrome if it is the same from the left to the right and from the right to the left. For example, the strings 'kek', 'abacaba', 'r' and 'papicipap' are palindromes, while the strings 'abb' and 'iq' are not.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) — the number of test cases.

The manhattan distance from square (a, b) to square (p, q) is calculated as |a−p|+|b−q|. If you try to place the device inside the enemy base, you will be captured by the enemy.

After that, m is subtracted from each remaining element. \n\n\n\nThus, after each operation, the length of the array is reduced by 1.\n\nFor example, if a = [1, 6, -4, -2, -4], then the minimum element in it is a_3 = -4, which means that after this operation the array will be equal to a=[1 {- (-4)}, 6 {- (-4)}, -2 {- (-4)}, -4 {- (-4)}] = [5, 10, 2, 0].\n\nSince Yelisey likes big numbers, he wants the numbers in the array a to be as big as possible.\n\nFormally speaking, he wants to make the minimum of the numbers in array a to be maximal possible (i.e. he want to maximize a minimum). To do this, Yelisey can apply the minimum extraction operation to the array as many times as he wants (possibly, zero).

On each edge of the tree, there's a set of Christmas lights, which can be represented by an integer in binary representation.\n\n<image>\n\nHe has m elves come over and admire his tree. Each elf is assigned two nodes, a and b, and that elf looks at all lights on the simple path between the two nodes. After this, the elf's favorite number becomes the [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) of the values of the lights on the edges in that path.\n\nHowever, the North Pole has been recovering from a nasty bout of flu. Because of this, Santa forgot some of the configurations of lights he had put on the tree, and he has already left the North Pole! Fortunately, the elves came to the rescue, and each one told Santa what pair of nodes he was assigned (a_i, b_i), as well as the parity of the number of set bits in his favorite number. In other words, he remembers whether the number of 1's when his favorite number is written in binary is odd or even.\n\nHelp Santa determine if it's possible that the memories are consistent, and if it is, remember what his tree looked like, and maybe you'll go down in history!\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains one integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4) — the number of test cases.

In this problem, we are talking about a variant of the game when the players are sitting at the table and everyone plays individually (i.e. not teams, but individual gamers play).\n\nn people gathered in a room with m tables (n ≥ 2m). They want to play the Hat k times. Thus, k games will be played at each table. Each player will play in k games.\n\nTo do this, they are distributed among the tables for each game. During each game, one player plays at exactly one table. A player can play at different tables.\n\nPlayers want to have the most \"fair\" schedule of games. For this reason, they are looking for a schedule (table distribution for each game) such that:\n\n  * At any table in each game there are either ⌊n/m⌋ people or ⌈n/m⌉ people (that is, either n/m rounded down, or n/m rounded up). Different numbers of people can play different games at the same table.\n  * Let's calculate for each player the value b_i — the number of times the i-th player played at a table with ⌈n/m⌉ persons (n/m rounded up). Any two values of b_imust differ by no more than 1. In other words, for any two players i and j, it must be true |b_i - b_j| ≤ 1. \n\n\n\nFor example, if n=5, m=2 and k=2, then at the request of the first item either two players or three players should play at each table. Consider the following schedules:\n\n  * First game: 1, 2, 3 are played at the first table, and 4, 5 at the second one. The second game: at the first table they play 5, 1, and at the second — 2, 3, 4. This schedule is not \"fair\" since b_2=2 (the second player played twice at a big table) and b_5=0 (the fifth player did not play at a big table).\n  * First game: 1, 2, 3 are played at the first table, and 4, 5 at the second one.

{"name": "1623_D. Robot Cleaner Revisit", "description": "The statement of this problem shares a lot with problem A. The differences are that in this problem, the probability is introduced, and the constraint is different.\n\nA robot cleaner is placed on the floor of a rectangle room, surrounded by walls. The floor consists of n rows and m columns. The rows of the floor are numbered from 1 to n from top to bottom, and columns of the floor are numbered from 1 to m from left to right. The cell on the intersection of the r-th row and the c-th column is denoted as (r,c). The initial position of the robot is (r_b, c_b).\n\nIn one second, the robot moves by dr rows and dc columns, that is, after one second, the robot moves from the cell (r, c) to (r + dr, c + dc). Initially dr = 1, dc = 1. If there is a vertical wall (the left or the right walls) in the movement direction, dc is reflected before the movement, so the new value of dc is -dc. And if there is a horizontal wall (the upper or lower walls), dr is reflected before the movement, so the new value of dr is -dr.\n\nEach second (including the moment before the robot starts moving), the robot cleans every cell lying in the same row or the same column as its position. There is only one dirty cell at (r_d, c_d). The job of the robot is to clean that dirty cell. \n\nAfter a lot of testings in problem A, the robot is now broken. It cleans the floor as described above, but at each second the cleaning operation is performed with probability \\frac p {100} only, and not performed with probability 1 - \\frac p {100}. The cleaning or not cleaning outcomes are independent each second.\n\nGiven the floor size n and m, the robot's initial position (r_b, c_b) and the dirty cell's position (r_d, c_d), find the expected time for the robot to do its job.\n\nIt can be shown that the answer can be expressed as an irreducible fraction \\frac x y, where x and y are integers and y not ≡ 0 \\pmod{10^9 + 7} . Output the integer equal to x ⋅ y^{-1} mod (10^9 + 7). In other words, output such an integer a that 0 ≤ a < 10^9 + 7 and a ⋅ y ≡ x \\pmod {10^9 + 7}.\n\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10). Description of the test cases follows.\n\nA test case consists of only one line, containing n, m, r_b, c_b, r_d, c_d, and p (4 ≤ n ⋅ m ≤ 10^5, n, m ≥ 2, 1 ≤ r_b, r_d ≤ n, 1 ≤ c_b, c_d ≤ m, 1 ≤ p ≤ 99) — the sizes of the room, the initial position of the robot, the position of the dirt cell and the probability of cleaning in percentage.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print a single integer — the expected time for the robot to clean the dirty cell, modulo 10^9 + 7.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n6\n2 2 1 1 2 1 25\n3 3 1 2 2 2 25\n10 10 1 1 10 10 75\n10 10 10 10 1 1 75\n5 5 1 3 2 2 10\n97 98 3 5 41 43 50\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n3\n3\n15\n15\n332103349\n99224487\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test case, the robot has the opportunity to clean the dirty cell every second. Using the [geometric distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_distribution), we can find out that with the success rate of 25\\%, the expected number of tries to clear the dirty cell is \\frac 1 {0.25} = 4. But because the first moment the robot has the opportunity to clean the cell is before the robot starts moving, the answer is 3.\n\n<image> Illustration for the first example. The blue arc is the robot. The red star is the target dirt cell. The purple square is the initial position of the robot. Each second the robot has an opportunity to clean a row and a column, denoted by yellow stripes.\n\nIn the second test case, the board size and the position are different, but the robot still has the opportunity to clean the dirty cell every second, and it has the same probability of cleaning. Therefore the answer is the same as in the first example.\n\n<image> Illustration for the second example.\n\nThe third and the fourth case are almost the same. The only difference is that the position of the dirty cell and the robot are swapped.

{"name": "1623_E. Middle Duplication", "description": "A binary tree of n nodes is given. Nodes of the tree are numbered from 1 to n and the root is the node 1. Each node can have no child, only one left child, only one right child, or both children. For convenience, let's denote l_u and r_u as the left and the right child of the node u respectively, l_u = 0 if u does not have the left child, and r_u = 0 if the node u does not have the right child.\n\nEach node has a string label, initially is a single character c_u. Let's define the string representation of the binary tree as the concatenation of the labels of the nodes in the in-order. Formally, let f(u) be the string representation of the tree rooted at the node u. f(u) is defined as follows: $$$ f(u) = \\begin{cases} <empty string>, & if u = 0; \\\\\\ f(l_u) + c_u + f(r_u) & otherwise, \\end{cases}  where +$$$ denotes the string concatenation operation.\n\nThis way, the string representation of the tree is f(1).\n\nFor each node, we can duplicate its label at most once, that is, assign c_u with c_u + c_u, but only if u is the root of the tree, or if its parent also has its label duplicated.\n\nYou are given the tree and an integer k. What is the lexicographically smallest string representation of the tree, if we can duplicate labels of at most k nodes?\n\nA string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if and only if one of the following holds: \n\n  * a is a prefix of b, but a ≠ b; \n  * in the first position where a and b differ, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b. \n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5).\n\nThe second line contains a string c of n lower-case English letters, where c_i is the initial label of the node i for 1 ≤ i ≤ n.
